# Deploykit User Flow

This guide walks you through how to use `omni-deployer` to deploy your smart contracts across multiple chains using the `SuperchainFactory`. The package supports two main commands:

- **`deploy`**: Deploys the same contract on multiple chains at the same address.
- **`deploy-hs`**: Deploys hub-and-spoke contracts (with potentially different bytecodes) on the same address across multiple chains.

## Prerequisites

> **Note:** If you are using Windows OS, you must run these commands inside **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** to ensure compatibility with Foundry and other tools.

Before starting:
- Ensure **Node.js** (16.x+) and **npm** are installed.
- Install **Foundry** globally (`forge` command available). [Instructions](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).
- Install **Supersim** by following [Instructions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim). (Optional if you're deploying on Superchain Devnets)
- Have a private key for the deployment account ready (set as an environment variable).

## Step-by-Step User Flow

### 1. Initialize Foundry Project

Before deploying, initialize a Foundry project:

```bash
forge init my-foundry-project
cd my-foundry-project
```

### 2. Install Omni-Deployer

Install the Omni-Deployer library:

```bash
npm i @omni-kit/omni-deployer
```

### 3. Run Supersim Anvil (Optional For Superchain Devnet Users)

> Note: If you are deploying contracts on Superchain Devnets as per the Optimism Console, you donâ€™t need to follow this step or install Supersim.

Start the Supersim Anvil to simulate the Superchain environment. You can specify the chains you want the contracts to deploy on:

```bash
supersim fork --network=sepolia --chains=op,base,mode --interop.autorelay
```

### 4. Create Your Smart Contracts

#### Example for `deploy` (Single Contract)

```solidity
// src/TestToken.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract TestToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol) ERC20(name, symbol) {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1_000_000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}
```

#### Example for `deploy-hs` (Hub-and-Spoke Contracts)

```solidity
// src/HubContract.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HubContract {
    address public admin;

    constructor(address _admin) {
        admin = _admin;
    }

    function doHubAction() external {
        // Hub-specific logic
    }
}
```

```solidity
// src/SpokeContract.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SpokeContract {
    address public adminAddress;

    constructor(address _adminAddress) {
        adminAddress = _adminAddress;
    }

    function doSpokeAction() external {
        // Spoke-specific logic
    }
}
```

### 5. Set Up Your Config File (Optional)

#### For `deploy` (Single Contract)

Create a file named `superchain.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "chains": [420120000, 420120001],
  "factoryContract": "0x5a0632d24ddae5B4CB511aBB134561b9396473b4",
  "contractName": "TestToken",
  "constructorArgs": ["MyToken", "MTK"],
  "rpcUrl": "https://interop-alpha-0.optimism.io",
  "salt": "mysalt"
}
```

#### For `deploy-hs` (Hub-and-Spoke Contracts)

Create a file named `hubAndSpokeConfig.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "chains": [420120000, 420120001],
  "factoryContract": "0x5a0632d24ddae5B4CB511aBB134561b9396473b4",
  "hubContract": "HubContract",
  "spokeContract": "SpokeContract",
  "hubConstructorArgs": ["0xYourAdminAddress"],
  "spokeConstructorArgs": ["0xYourAdminAddress"],
  "salt": "deployHS",
  "rpcUrl": "https://interop-alpha-0.optimism.io"
}
```

### 6. Set Your Private Key

Export your private key securely:

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=0xYourPrivateKey
```

### 7. Run Omni-Deployer

#### With a Config File

For `deploy` (Single Contract):

```bash
npx omni-deployer deploy superchain.json
```

For `deploy-hs` (Hub-and-Spoke Contracts):

```bash
npx omni-deployer deploy-hs hubAndSpokeConfig.json
```

#### Without a Config File (Interactive Mode)

For `deploy`:

```bash
npx omni-deployer deploy
```

For `deploy-hs`:

```bash
npx omni-deployer deploy-hs
```

Youâ€™ll be asked to provide:
- **Chain IDs:** Comma-separated list (e.g., `420120000,420120001`).
- **Factory Contract Address:** use **`0x5a0632d24ddae5B4CB511aBB134561b9396473b4`** address (currently deployed on OP-BASE-MODE sepolia, Superchain Devnets 0 & 1).
- **Contract Name(s):** For `deploy`, enter the contract name; for `deploy-hs`, enter hub and spoke contract names.
- **Constructor Arguments:** Enter as a JSON array (e.g., `{"0xYourAdminAddress"}`) or comma-separated list.
- **Salt:** Enter a salt string (e.g., `deployHS`).
- **RPC URL:** Enter the RPC endpoint (e.g., `https://interop-alpha-0.optimism.io`).

### 8. What Happens

- Compiles your contracts with `forge build`.
- For `deploy`: Deploys the contract to the chain at `rpcUrl` and sends cross-chain messages to deploy it on other chains at the same address.
- For `deploy-hs`: Deploys the hub contract on the chain at `rpcUrl` and sends cross-chain messages to deploy spoke contracts on the chains listed in `chains` at the same address.
- Outputs the transaction hash and deployed addresses.
- checkout [Omnikit](https://github.com/Omni-kit/omnikit/blob/main/src/CrossChainDeploymentFactory.sol) to working of the Contract underhood.

### 9. Verify Output

#### Example for `deploy`

```
Compiling contract with forge build...
Deploying contract across chains: [420120000, 420120001]
Transaction hash: 0x...
Deployed contract address on local chain: 0x...
Computed CREATE2 address (for all chains): 0x...
Contract has been deployed across all specified chains.
```

#### Example for `deploy-hs`

```
Compiling contracts with forge build...
Deploying hub and spoke contracts...
Transaction hash: 0x...
Deployed hub contract address on local chain: 0x...
Computed CREATE3 address (for all chains): 0x...
Hub and spoke contracts have been deployed across specified chains.
```

## Conclusion

With `omni-deployer`, you can easily deploy contracts across multiple chains using either a configuration file or interactive prompts. The `deploy` command is ideal for deploying identical contracts, while `deploy-hs` supports hub-and-spoke architectures with different bytecodes at the same address.
